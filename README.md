This project contains the assignments on the data organization course. There are four directories.

    assignment_1 is about using basic data types C++ - integer, character, string, etc. How to use basic data type to tackle math problems.

    assignment_2 works around with pointer and sorting in C++. There are problems about the relationship between string and pointer in C++.

    assignment_3 exibits how to use STRUCT to work with abstraction data types - linked list, queue, tree. It shows common methods when working on those kind of data.
